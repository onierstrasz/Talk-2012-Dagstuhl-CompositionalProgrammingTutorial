# Abstract

This talk surveys the evolution of compositional paradigms in programming from the 1950s through to the present day.  In particular, we explore the innovations introdiced by procedural programming, object-oriented langauges, component-based development, and model-driven engineering.

- patterns

## Components
- components, black box frameworks
- scripting, DSLs, Piccola

- plugin architectures
- SOA

## Fine-grained adaptation
- reflection, MOPs, Mirrors
- AOP
- Dependency injection
- COP

## Features
- Flavors, Mixins
- Traits, Talents
- features, FOP
